# Nx

Based on "Installation" at https://nx.dev/getting-started/installation

Install **Nx** (required for Nx Monorepos and Nx Cloud) globally as follows:

```
$ npm add --global nx@latest
```

To use **nx** directly, you can now just use:

```
$ nx --version
```

To update **nx**, run:

```
$ cd hatch-project/src/hatch_project
$ npx nx migrate latest # if nx has not yet been installed
$ nx migrate latest     # if nx has already been installed
```

Based on the provided repository structure and documentation, I'll help you run the Hatch project. The project appears to be set up as a React monorepo using Nx. Here are the steps to run it:


1. First, make sure you're in the root directory of the repository:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/repository
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm ci  # This installs dependencies exactly as specified in package-lock.json
```

3. Install the Nx CLI globally (if not already installed):
```bash
npm install -g @nrwl/cli
```

4. To serve the application in development mode:
```bash
npx nx serve hatch_project
```

This will:
- Start a development server
- Usually be available at http://localhost:4200
- Auto-reload when you make changes

5. Alternatively, if you want to build the application:
```bash
npx nx build hatch_project
```

For production build:
```bash
npx nx build hatch_project --configuration=production
```

To run tests:
```bash
npx nx test hatch_project
```

If you want to run multiple tasks in parallel (e.g., build all projects):
```bash
npx nx run-many -t build --all
```

To generate code:
```bash
npx nx g @nrwl/react:component my-component
```

Common issues and solutions:

If you get path-related errors, make sure your nx.json is properly configured with the correct paths for your nested structure:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "hatch_project": {
      "root": "hatch-project/src/hatch_project",
      "sourceRoot": "hatch-project/src/hatch_project/src",
      "projectType": "application"
    }
  }
}
```

If you encounter issues with the Nx CLI, ensure it's properly installed:

npm install -g @nrwl/cli

2. If you get Nx Cloud connection issues, you may need to reconnect:

```bash
nx generate @nx/workspace:disconnect-cloud
nx connect-to-nx-cloud
```

3. If you need to clean the cache:

```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

Remember that all Nx commands should be run from the root of the repository where the nx.json file is located.
